# Caddy Manager

Web-based management platform for administering Caddy servers through a secure, user-friendly interface. It combines a visual route builder with an advanced JSON escape hatch, backed by a dedicated API service.

## Architecture

```
Browser
  ↓
Web Application  (React + Vite + TypeScript)
  ↓
API Service      (Node.js + Fastify + TypeScript)
  ↓
Caddy Admin API  (external, user-managed Caddy instances)
```

## Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 20
- pnpm >= 9
- Docker & Docker Compose (for deployment)
- PostgreSQL 16+ (or use the Docker Compose setup)
- A running Caddy instance with Admin API enabled

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build all packages
pnpm build

# Start development
pnpm dev

# Run checks
pnpm typecheck
pnpm --filter @caddy-manager/web test
pnpm --filter @caddy-manager/web build

# Migrate the database and create the initial admin user
pnpm seed:admin
```

## Deployment

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Set `CADDY_ALLOWED_HOSTS` in `.env` before starting. If Caddy runs in another
container, attach it to the generated `caddy-manager_internal` network so the
API can reach it. The API is intentionally not published directly; access it
through the web container on `WEB_PORT`.

See [`docs/DOCKER.md`](docs/DOCKER.md) for Compose and deployment details.
